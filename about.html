        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! Iâ€™m Pooja Joseph, a passionate and driven individual with a strong focus on personal growth and 
            making meaningful contributions. I am known for my adaptability, creativity, and positive attitude, 
            which help me thrive in challenging environments.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a person, I value resilience and mindfulness. I believe in building strong relationships and 
            collaborating effectively with others to achieve shared goals. My dedication to continuous improvement 
            has shaped me into someone who approaches challenges with confidence and a solution-oriented mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy <strong>swimming</strong>, which brings me a sense of peace and physical 
            well-being, and <strong>journaling</strong>, where I channel my thoughts and emotions into a creative 
            outlet. These activities not only keep me grounded but also fuel my creativity and inner strength.
